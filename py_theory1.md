Python is interpreted.
Well known to be used in the fields covering:
Backend web servers
DevOps and cloud engineering
Machine learning
Scripting and automation

In pyton you can use numbers inside print function
```py
    print((250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4)
```

# Variables - snake_case
Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that *value can change* (it varies).
```python
    my_height = 100
    my_name = "Lane"
    print(my_height)
```

# Storing Results
```py
    summation = a + b  # Addition
    difference = a - b # Subtraction
    product = a * b    # Multiplication
    quotient = a / b   # Division
```

# Single LineComments
```python
    # speed describes how fast the player
    # moves in meters per second
    speed = 2
```

# Multi-line comments
```python
    """
        the code found below
        will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
    """
    print("Hello, World!")
```


### Variable types 

# Integer
```pyton
    x = 5 # positive integer
    y = -5 # negative integer
```
# Float
```pyton
    z = 3.14 # positive float
    w = -3.14 # negative float
```
# String
```pyton
    a = "Hello" # string
    b = 'World' # string
```
# Boolean
```pyton
    c = True # boolean
    d = False # boolean
```

# F-STRINGS
```python
    name = "Yarl"
    age = 37
    race = "dwarf"
    print(f"{name} is a {race} who is {age} years old.")
```

# None
```python
    my_mental_acuity = None
```

# Dynamic typing
Python is dynamically typed, which means a variable can store any type, and that type can change.

# Concatenation
```python
    first_name = "Lane "
    last_name = "Wagner"
    full_name = first_name + last_name
    print(full_name)
    # prints "Lane Wagner"
```

# Multi-Variable Declaration
```python
    sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

# Functions
```python
    def area_of_circle(r):
        pi = 3.14
        result = pi * r * r
        return result
```

# No hoisting
If you define a function, you can't call that function until after it has been defined.
Most Python developers solve this problem by defining all the functions in their program first, then they call an "entry point" function last. That way all of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called.
Conventionally this *"entry point"* function is usually called main to keep things simple and consistent.

```python
    def main():
        health = 10
        armor = 5
        add_armor(health, armor)
    
    def add_armor(h, a):
        new_health = h + a
        print_health(new_health)
    
    def print_health(new_health):
        print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")
    
    # call entrypoint last
    main()
```

# None return
When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None.

# Multiple return values
```python
    def cast_iceblast(wizard_level, start_mana):
        damage = wizard_level * 2
        new_mana = start_mana - 10
        return damage, new_mana # return two values
```

# Parameter vs Argument
*Parameters* are the names used for inputs when *defining a function*. *Arguments* are the values of the inputs supplied when a *function is called*.
```python
    # a and b are parameters
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    
    # 5 and 6 are arguments
    sum = add(5, 6)
```

# Default Values
A default value is created by using the assignment (=) operator in the function signature.
```python
    def get_greeting(email, name="there"):
        print("Hello", name, "welcome! You've registered your email:", email) 
```

# Scope
Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used.
```python
    def subtract(x, y):
        return x - y
    result = subtract(5, 3)
    print(x)
    # ERROR! "name 'x' is not defined"
```

# Global scope
A variable or a function, that name is accessible in every other place in our program, even within other functions.

# Unit Test 
An automated program that tests the small "unit" of code

# Floor Division
Floor division is a division operation that rounds down to the nearest whole number.
```python
    7 // 3
    # 2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
    -7 // 3
    # -3 (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)
```

# Exponents
```python
    # reads as "three squared" or
    # "three raised to the second power"
    3 ** 2
    # 9
```

# ‚ùó
Sometimes exponents are also shown in text using the caret symbol (^):
5^3 = 125

# Changing in Place
+=
-=
*=
/=

# SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
Way of expressing numbers that are too large or too small to conveniently write normally.
In a nutshell, the number following the e specifies how many places to move the decimal to the right for a positive number, or to the left for a negative number.
1,024,000,000,000,000,000 (1.024e18)

```PY
    print(16e3)
    # Prints 16000.0
    print(7.1e-2)
    # Prints 0.071
```

# Underscores for readability
```python
    num = 16_000
    print(num)
    # Prints 16000
    
    num = 16_000_000
    print(num)
    # Prints 16000000
```

```python
    def update_player_score(current_score, increment):
        current_score += increment
        return current_score
```

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
- and
- or
- not

```python
    print(True and True)
    # prints True
    
    print(True or False)
    # prints True
    
    print(not True)
    # Prints: False
```

# BINARY NUMBERS - BASE 2 NUMBERS
Each 1 in a binary number represents an ever-greater multiple of 2. In a 4-digit number, that means you have the eights place, the fours place, the twos place, and the ones place. Similar to how in decimal you would have the thousands place, the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place.

```python
    print(0b0001)
    # Prints 1
    
    print(0b0101)
    # Prints 5
```
Leading 0s are often added for visual consistency but do not change the value of a binary number.

0 = 0
1 = 1
2 = 10
3 = 11
4 = 100 2^2
5 = 101
6 = 110
7 = 111
8 = 1000 2^3
9 = 1001
10 = 1010
11 = 1011
12 = 1100

16 = 10000 /2^4
31 = 11111
32 = 100000 /2^5
33 = 100001
34 = 100010

# BITWISE OPERATOR &
Bitwise operators are similar to logical operators, but instead of operating on boolean values, they apply the same logic to all the bits in a value by column.

```python
    0101
    &
    0111
    =
    0101
```

A 1 in binary is the same as True, while 0 is False. So really a bitwise operation is just a bunch of logical operations that are completed in tandem by column.

0 & 0 = 0

1 & 1 = 1

1 & 0 = 0

# Ampersand & is the bitwise AND operator in Python.
```python
    0b0101 & 0b0111
    # equals 5
    
    binary_five = 0b0101
    binary_seven = 0b0111
    binary_five & binary_seven
    # equals 5
```

# BITWISE OPERATOR |
```pyton
    0101
    |
    0111
    =
    0111
```

# int()
The built-in int() function can convert a binary string to an integer.

```python
    # this is a binary string
    binary_string = "100"
    
    # convert binary string to integer
    num = int(binary_string, 2)
    print(num)
    # 4
```

# Comparison operators
When a comparison happens, the result of the comparison is just a boolean value, it's either True or False.
The operators:

< "less than"
> "greater than"
<= "less than or equal to"
>= "greater than or equal to"
== "equal to"
!= "not equal to"

# IF STATEMENTS
```python
    def show_status(boss_health):
        if boss_health > 0:
            print("Ganondorf is alive!")
            return
        print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

```python
    is_equal = 5 == 5
    print(is_equal)
    # True
```

```python
        def check_swords_for_army(number_of_swords, number_of_soldiers):
            if (number_of_swords == number_of_soldiers):
                return 'correct amount'
        return "incorrect amount"
```

# IF ELSE
An if statement can be followed by zero or more elif (which stands for "else if") statements, which can be followed by zero or one else statements.
```python
    if score > high_score:
        print("High score beat!")
    elif score > second_highest_score:
        print("You got second place!")
    elif score > third_highest_score:
        print("You got third place!")
    else:
        print("Better luck next time")
```

```python
    def player_status(health):
        if (health <= 0):
            return "dead"
        elif (health <= 5 ):
            return "injured"
        else:
            return "healthy"
```

```pyton
    def should_serve_customer(customer_age, on_break, time):
        return customer_age >= 21 and not on_break and (time >= 5 and time <= 10)
```

```python
    def check_mount_rental(time_used, time_purchased):
        if (time_used >= time_purchased):
            return "overtime charged"
        else:
            return "no charges yet"
```

```python
    def combat_evaluation(player_power, enemy_defense):
        advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched = False, False, False

    if (player_power > enemy_defense):
        advantage = True
        evenly_matched = False
        disadvantage = False
    elif (player_power == enemy_defense):
        evenly_matched = True
        advantage = False
        disadvantage = False
    else: 
        evenly_matched = False
        advantage = False
        disadvantage = True

    return advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched
```

# LOOPS
Loops allow us to do the same operation multiple times without having to write it explicitly each time.

If i is not less than 10 (range(0, 10)), exit the loop.
```python
    for i in range(0, 10):
        print(i)
```

The body of a for-loop must be indented; otherwise, you'll get a syntax error.

# RANGE + STEP
The range() function we've been using in our for loops actually has an optional 3rd parameter: the "step".

```python
    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)
    # prints:
    # 0
    # 2
    # 4
    # 6
    # 8
```

# LOOP BACKWARD
```python
    for i in range(3, 0, -1):
        print(i)
    # prints:
    # 3
    # 2
    # 1
```

```python
    def count_down(start, end):
        for i in range(start, end, -1):
            print(i)
    
    def test(start, end):
        print(f"Using inputs start: {start} and end: {end}")
        print(f"Printing numbers from {start} to {end + 1}:")
        count_down(start, end)
        print("=====================================")

    def main():
        test(10, 0)
        test(20, 10)
        test(15, 11)
        
    main()
```

```python
    def sum_of_numbers(start, end):
        total = 0
        for i in range(start, end):
            total += i
        return total
```

```python
    def sum_of_odd_numbers(end):
        total = 0
        for i in range(0, end):
            if (i % 2 != 0):
                total += i
        return total
```

# WHILE
It's a loop that continues while a condition remains True.
Example of infinite loop - since the condition is always true it goes forever
```python
    while 1:
        print("1 evaluates to True")

    # prints:
    # 1 evaluates to True
    # 1 evaluates to True
    # (...continuing)
```
```python
    num = 0
    while num < 3:
        num += 1
        print(num)
```
```python
    def regenerate(current_health, max_health, enemy_distance):

        while current_health < max_health and enemy_distance > 3:
            current_health += 1
            enemy_distance -= 2
            print(current_health, enemy_distance)
        return current_health
```

# CONTINUE 
Used to skip some items in a loop
```python
    counter = 0
    for number in range(1, 51):
        counter = counter + 1

        if counter == 7:
            counter = 0 # Reset the counter
            continue # Skip this number

        print(number)
```

Award the player every third quest
```python  
    def award_enchantments(start, end, step):
        counter = 0
        for quest_number in range(start, end, step):
            counter += 1
            if (counter < 3):
                continue
        
            enchantment_strength = quest_number * 5
            counter = 0
            print(
                f"Enchantment of strength {enchantment_strength} awarded for completing {quest_number} quests!"
            )
```

# BREAK
Used to exit the loop entirely
```python
    for n in range(42):
        print(f"{n} * {n} = {n * n}")
        if n * n > 150:
            break
```
 
```python   
    def check_defense(attack_strength, min_enchantment, max_enchantment):
        for enchantment_strength in range(min_enchantment, max_enchantment + 1):
            print(
                f"Comparing attack strength {attack_strength} to enchantment strength {enchantment_strength}."
            )

            if enchantment_strength >= attack_strength:
                print("Attack blocked!")
                break
```

```python
    def calculate_experience_points(level):
        xp = 0
        for i in range(0, level):
            xp += i * 5
            print(xp)
        return xp
```

```python
    def meditate(mana, max_mana, num_potions):
        while mana < max_mana and num_potions > 0:
            mana +=1
            num_potions -= 1
        return mana, num_potions
```

### LISTS
A natural way to organize and store data. Equivalent of array in js.

```python
    inventory = ["Iron Breastplate", "Healing Potion", "Leather Scraps"]
    
    flower_types = [
        "daffodil",
        "rose",
        "chrysanthemum"
    ]
    print(flower_types[0])
    # daffodil
    
    inventory = ["Leather", "Iron Ore", "Healing Potion"]
    inventory[0] = "Leather Armor"
    # inventory: ['Leather Armor', 'Iron Ore', 'Healing Potion']
    
```

# LEN
Get length of a list
```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pear"]
    length = len(fruits)
    # 3
```

# APPEND
Add values to the end of the list
```python
    cards = []
    cards.append("nvidia")
    cards.append("amd")
```

```python
    def generate_user_list(num_of_users):
        player_ids = []

        for i in range(0, num_of_users):
            player_ids.append(i)

        return player_ids
```

# POP   
Remove the last element of the list AND RETURNS it.

```python
    vegetables = ["broccoli", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"]
    last_vegetable = vegetables.pop()
    # vegetables = ['broccoli', 'cabbage', 'kale']
    # last_vegetable = 'tomato'
```

# POP an element with a specific index
```python
    vegetables = ["broccoli", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"]
    second_vegetable = vegetables.pop(1)
    # vegetables = ['broccoli', 'kale', 'tomato']
    # second_vegetable = 'cabbage'
```

```python
    for i in range(0, len(sports)):
        print(sports[i])
```

# FOR IN
```python
    trees = ['oak', 'pine', 'maple']
    for tree in trees:
        print(tree)
    # Prints:
    # oak
    # pine
    # maple
```
```python
    def find_max(nums):
        max_so_far = float("-inf")
        for number in nums:
            if (number > max_so_far):
                max_so_far = number
        return max_so_far
```

# MODULO
The modulo operator can be used to find the remainder after a division operation.

```python
    def get_odd_numbers(num):
        odd_numbers = []

        for i in range(0, num):
            if (i % 2 != 0):
                odd_numbers.append(i)
        return odd_numbers
```

# SLICING LISTS
Slicing operator - :
Start index, end index (not inclusive), step

```python
    my_list[ start : stop : step ]
```
give me a slice of the scores list from index 1, up to but not including 5, skipping every 2nd value:
```python
    scores = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
    # Display list
    print(scores[1:5:2])
    # Prints [70, 20]
```    

Omitting values 
- all up to index 3(not including)
[:3]

- all from index 3(including)
[3:]

- all from index 1 to index 5(not including)
[1:5]

- all from index 1 to index 5(not including) skipping every 2nd value
[1:5:2]

# Using only step 
```python
    numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    numbers[::2] 
    # Gives [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

```python
    def get_champion_slices(champions):
        first = []
        second = []
        third = []
        for i in range(3):
            if i == 0:
                first = champions[2:]
            elif i == 1:
                second = champions[:len(champions) - 1]
            else:
                third = champions[::2]
                
        return first, second, third


    def get_champion_slices(champions):
        return champions[2:], champions[:-1], champions[::2]

```

# NEGATIVE INDICES
Count from the end of the list

# LIST CONCATENATION
```python
    total = [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]
    print(total)
    # Prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

# LIST INCLUDES
```python
    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
    print("banana" in fruits)
    # Prints: True
    
    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
    print("banana" not in fruits)
    # Prints: False
```
### LIST DELETION
Python has a built-in keyword del that deletes items from objects. In the case of a list, you can delete specific indexes or entire slices.

# DELETE NTH ITEM
```python
    del nums[3]
```

# DELETE ITEMS FROM INDEX 1 TO 3(EXCLUDING)
```python
    del nums[1:3]
```

# DELETE ALL ELEMENTS
```python
    del nums[:]
```

# Delete last two items
```py
    def trim_strongholds(strongholds):
        del strongholds[len(strongholds) - 2:]
```

### TUPLES
Collections of data that are ORDERED and UNCHANGEABLE.
We can think about it as a list with fixed size
```py
    my_tuple = ("this is a tuple", 45, True)
    print(my_tuple[0])
    # this is a tuple
    print(my_tuple[1])
    # 45
    print(my_tuple[2])
    # True
```

Tuples are often used to store very small groups (like 2 or 3 items) of data. For example, you might use a tuple to store a dog's name and age.
```python
    dog = ("Fido", 4)
```


# tuple with only one item (coma at the end)
```py
    my_tuple = ("this is a tuple",)
```

# multiple tuples in a list
```python
    my_tuples = [
    ("this is the first tuple in the list", 45, True),
    ("this is the second tuple in the list", 21, False)
    ]
    print(my_tuples[0][0]) # this is the first tuple in the list
    print(my_tuples[0][1]) # 45
```

# tuple unpacking
Similar to array destructuring in js
You can easily assign the values of a tuple to variables using unpacking.
```py
    dog = ("Fido", 4)
    dog_name, dog_age = dog
    print(dog_name)
    # Fido
    print(dog_age)
    # 4
```
‚ùó When you return multiple values from a function, you're actually returning a tuple.

# LOOP STEP 
Complete the sum_of_odd_numbers function. It should calculate the sum of all the odd numbers starting at 1 up to (but not including) the given end number and return the result.

```py
    def sum_of_odd_numbers(end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, end, 2):
        total += i
    return total
```

```python
    def countdown_to_start():
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        if i == 1:
            print(f"{i}...Fight!")
        else:
            print(f"{i}...")
```

# return reversed list
```python
    def reverse_list(items):
        reversed = []
        for i in range(len(items) - 1, 0, -1):
        reversed.append(items[i])
        print(reversed)
    return items
```

# .split()
method called on a string -  returns a list by splitting the string based on a given delimiter.

```python
    message = "hello there sam"
    words = message.split()
    print(words)
    # Prints: ["hello", "there", "sam"]
```

# .join()
The .join() method is called on a delimiter (what goes between all the words in the list), and takes a list of strings as input.

```python
    list_of_words = ["hello", "there", "sam"]
    sentence = " ".join(list_of_words)
    print(sentence)
    # Prints: "hello there sam"
```

### DICTIONARIES
Used to store key values pairs in python
Keys must be unique.
‚ùó Keys names in parentheses 

```python
    car = {
        "brand": "Toyota",
        "model": "Camry",
        "year": 2019,
    }
```

# Accessing dictionary values
To access value from the dictionary we use square brackets
```python
    car = {
        "make": "Toyota",
        "model": "Camry"
    }
    print(car["make"])
    # Prints: Toyota
```

# Edit dictionary values
We use the same syntax to add / edit values withing dictionary
```python
   planets = {}
    planets["Earth"] = True
    planets["Pluto"] = False
    print(planets["Pluto"])
    # Prints False 
```
```python
    names = ["jack bronson", "jill mcarty", "john denver"]

    names_dict = {}
    for name in names:
        name_list = name.split()
        names_dict[name_list[0]] = name_list[1]

    print(names_dict)
    # Prints: {'jack': 'bronson', 'jill': 'mcarty', 'john': 'denver'}
```

# Delete dictionary values
‚ùóIf we try to delete a key that does not exist - we get an error
```python
    names_dict = {
        "jack": "bronson",
        "jill": "mcarty",
        "joe": "denver"
    }

    del names_dict["joe"]
    print(names_dict)
    # Prints: {'jack': 'bronson', 'jill': 'mcarty'}
```

# Includes 
Similarly to checking values within an array or a string we use *in* and *not in*

```python
    cars = {
    "ford": "f150",
    "toyota": "camry"
    }

    print("ford" in cars)
    # Prints: True
    
    print("gmc" in cars)
    # Prints: False
```


# Checking if dictionary is empty
use *not*
```python
    dict = {}
    if not dict:
        print('empty dictionary')
```

# ORDERED VS UNORDERED DICTIONARY
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.

Because dictionaries are ordered, the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, so you couldn't refer to an item by using an index.

The takeaway is that if you're on Python 3.7 or later, you'll be able to iterate over dictionaries in the same order every time.

```python
    # Python 3.6 and earlier
    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "NYC"}
    
    for key in my_dict:
        print(key)  # Might print: age, name, city
                    # Next time you run it: city, name, age
                    # Order is random/inconsistent
```

# Nested dictionary example
```python  
    {
        "entity": {
            "character": {
                "name": "Kaladin",
                "quests": {
                    "bridge_run": {
                        "status": "In Progress",
                    },
                    "talk_to_syl": {
                        "status": "Completed",
                    },
                },
            }
        }
    }
    
    def get_quest_status(progress):
        return progress['entity']['character']['quests']['bridge_run']['status']

```

# Merge dictionaries 
```python
    def merge(dict1, dict2):
        empty = {}
        for key in dict1:
            empty[key] = dict1[key]
        for key in dict2:
            empty[key] = dict2[key]
        return empty
```

# Sets
- Like lists but unordered and with unique values

```python
    first_ids = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    s1 = set(first_ids)
    print(s1) # {1, 2, 3}

    fruits = {"apple", "banana", "grape"}
    print(type(fruits))
    # Prints: <class 'set'>
    
```



# .add()
```python
    fruits = {"apple", "banana", "grape"}
    fruits.add("pear")
    print(fruits)
    # Prints: {'banana', 'grape', 'pear', 'apple'}
    
    fruits2 = set()
    fruits2.add("pear")
    print(fruits2)
    # Prints: {'pear'}
```

# remove()

```python
    fruits = {"apple", "banana", "grape"}
    fruits.remove("apple")
```

# set iteration
```pyton
    fruits = {"apple", "banana", "grape"}
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)
        # Prints:
        # banana
        # grape
        # apple
```

# sets subtraction
You can use some of the "normal" mathematical operations on sets. For example, you can subtract one set from another. It removes all the values in the second set from the first set.

```python
    set1 = {"apple", "banana", "grape"}
    set2 = {"apple", "banana"}
    set3 = set1 - set2
    
    print(set3)
    # Prints: {'grape'}
```

### Errors and Exceptions
# Catching errors
```python
    try:
        10 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        print('got you', e)
```

# Raising exceptions
When something in our own code happens that isn't the "happy path", we should raise our own exceptions.
An error or exception is raised when something bad happens, but as long as our code handles it as users expect it to, it's not a bug. A bug is when code behaves in ways our users don't expect it to.

```python
    def craft_sword(metal_bar):
        if metal_bar == "bronze":
            return "bronze sword"
        if metal_bar == "iron":
            return "iron sword"
        if metal_bar == "steel":
            return "steel sword"
        raise Exception("invalid metal bar")
```
# ‚ùå Don't catch your own exceptions
```python
    # don't do this
    def craft_sword(metal_bar):
        try:
            if metal_bar == "bronze":
                return "bronze sword"
            if metal_bar == "iron":
                return "iron sword"
            if metal_bar == "steel":
                return "steel sword"
            raise Exception("invalid metal bar")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

# ‚úÖ do this
```python 
        try:
            craft_sword("gold bar")
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
```

# Different types of exceptions
there are different types of exceptions, and we can handle them differently depending on the situation. Some 
exceptions are more specific, like ZeroDivisionError (which happens when you divide by zero) or IndexError (which happens when you try to access a list element at an invalid index‚Äîeither too high or too low). Others are more general, like the base Exception.

```python
    try:
        10/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("0 division")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    
    try:
        nums = [0, 1]
        print(nums[2])
    except IndexError:
        print("index error")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

When handling exceptions, it‚Äôs important to catch the most specific ones first, because Python stops checking once it finds a matching exception handler. If you catch a more general Exception first, any specific errors will never get handled individually.
```python
    try:
        nums = [0, 1]
        print(nums[2])
    except Exception: # ‚ùå
        print("An error occurred")
    except IndexError:
        print("Index error")
        
        
        # this will print "other"
        try:
            raise Exception("zero division")
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            print("zero")
        except Exception as e:
            print("other")
```

# infinity
```python
     my_infinity = float("inf")
     lowest_number = float("-inf")
```

# type()
```python
    type(1) == int
    # True

    type("1") == str
    # True
    
    type(1.0) == float
    # True
    
    type("seventy-six") == int
    # False
    
    def remove_nonints(nums):
        integers = []
        for num in nums:
            if type(num) == int:
                integers.append(num)
        return integers
```


# list()
- retrieve key value pairs from dictionary and turn it into a list of tuples
- ‚ÑπÔ∏èsee bookbot project for examples
```python
    dict = {}
    l = list(dict.items()) # <class 'list'>
    print(type(l)) # <class 'list'>
```

# list.sort()
Sorts original list, and returns None
sort() automatically passes each element of the list to the function assigned to key

```python
    dict =  [('t', {'num': 29493}), ('h', {'num': 19176})]

    def getSingleItemCount(tuple):
        return tuple[1]["num"]
        
  l = list(dict.items()) 
  sorted =  l.sort(key=getSingleItemCount, reverse=True )
  # print('‚ùå .sort() is sorting in place and returns nothing we need to return original list:', sorted, )
```

# the same with lambda function
```python
    dict =  [('t', {'num': 29493}), ('h', {'num': 19176})]

  l = list(dict.items()) 
  sorted =  l.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]["num"], reverse=True )
  # print('‚ùå .sort() is sorting in place and returns nothing we need to return original list:', sorted, )
```

# lambda function 
- anonymous
- single expression
- no return statement - expression is automatically returned 
```python
    add_five = lambda x: x + 5
    add = lambda a, b: a + b
    print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```
#  regular function
```python
    def add_five(x):
        return x + 5
```

# importing built in modules 
```python
    import sys
```

# importing custom modules
```python
    from stats import count_words, count_chars, sort_dictionary, generateReport
```

# sys()
- The built in sys module provides access to command line arguments.
- Can be used for example to read contents of the file based on the file name received from the command line argument

```shell
    python3 main.py books/mobydick.txt          
```

```python
    print(sys.argv)
    # Prints [<current directory>]
    
      args = sys.argv
        if len(args) < 2:
            print('Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>')
            sys.exit(1)
        else:
            fileName = args[1]
            print(generateReport(fileName))
```

# Class
- special type in OOP 
- templates for creating objects
- object is aa instance of a class
- classes provide structure
- can have methods
```pyton
    class Soldier:
        health = 5
        armor = 3
        damage = 2
        
    # instance of integer typ        
    health = 50
    # instance of Soldier class
    aragorn = Soldier()
    print(aragorn.health)
    # 5
```

# Methods
- methods are defined within class declaration
```python
    class Soldier:
    health = 5

    # This is a method that reduces the
    # health of the soldier
    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.health -= damage

    soldier_one = Soldier()
    soldier_one.take_damage(2)
    print(soldier_one.health)
    # prints "3"    
```

# Self
- used to read and update properties of an object
- you need to pass self as an argument to the method body
```python
    class Wall:
    armor = 10
    height = 5

    def fortify(self):
        self.armor *= 2
```

# Method with returned vals
- can but don't have to return any value as they are used primarily to modify properties of an object
```python
    class Soldier:
        armor = 2
        num_weapons = 2
    
        def get_speed(self):
            speed = 10
            speed -= self.armor
            speed -= self.num_weapons
            return speed
    
    soldier_one = Soldier()
    print(soldier_one.get_speed()) 
    # prints "6"
```

# Method vs function
- method and function are exact same thing, the only difference being that methods are tied to an object and can 
  access given object properties
- A method  receives the object it was called on as its first parameter (self)
```python
    # helm_of_mordune (object itself) will be a method first parameter
    helm_of_mordune.enchant(mana, power)
```

# Constructor 
- proper way of creating classes is by using a *constructor* witch in python is a special method __init__
```python
  class Proper_soldier:
    def __init__(self, name, armor = 1, weapon = 1):
      self.name = name
      self.armor = armor
      self.weapon = weapon

    soldier_one = Proper_soldier("Aragorn", 20, 50)
    print(soldier_one.name)
    print(soldier_one)
``` 

# Avoid class variables‚ùóand use instance variables 
- Just like global variables, class variables are usually a bad idea because they make it hard to keep track of which parts of your program are making updates.
```python
    # ‚ùå class variable
    class Human:
      height = 10
    
    person = Human()
    Human.height = 20 # updates all instances of a Human ‚ùó
    
    
    # ‚úÖ instance variable
    class ProperHuman:
      def __init__(self):
        height = self.height
    
    propertPerson = ProperHuman(100)
```

# Encapsulation
- Practice of hiding complexity inside a "black box"
- The simplest example of encapsulation is a function - no need to know exactly what is happening inside it, we just 
  need to know how to use it
- encapsulation in Python is achieved mostly by convention rather than by force.

# Public vs Private properties
- by default all class properties and methods are public
- they can be accessed simply by using "." operator

Private data members are a way to encapsulate logic and data within a class definition.

# Creating private properties
- use two underscores

```python
  class Wall:
    def __init__(self, armor, magic_resistance):
      self.__armor = armor
      self.__magic_resistance = magic_resistance
  
    def get_defense(self):
      return self.__armor + self.__magic_resistance
  
  front_wall = Wall(10, 20)
  
  # This works
  print(front_wall.get_defense())
  # 30
  
  print(front_wall.__armor)
  # AttributeError: 'Wall' object has no attribute '__armor'

```
