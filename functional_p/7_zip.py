# Complete the pair_document_with_format function. It takes two lists of strings as input:

# doc_names: the names of documents
# doc_formats: the file formats of the documents
# zip up the lists into a single list of tuples with the names as the first index and the formats as the second index in each tuple.
# filter the list of tuples to only include tuples where the format is one of the given valid_formats.
# Return the result as a list.

    "docx",
    "pdf",
    "txt",
    "pptx",
